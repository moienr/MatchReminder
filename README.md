# Barcelona Match Reminder

Me and my friends are big fans of FC Barcelona. We always watch the matches together(virtually, each in a different time zone). Since the Pandemic, one of always had to Send a message about the upcoming match. I thought it would be a good idea to automate this process. So I created this telegram bot. It uses `Football API` to get the upcoming matches and sends a message to the group chat,, with the time zone of each of us.
